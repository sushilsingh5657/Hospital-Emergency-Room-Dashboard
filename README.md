# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard
This Excel dashboard provides a holistic view of emergency room operations and patient flow throughout the year. It consolidates critical healthcare KPIs in a visually intuitive format, empowering hospital administrators and decision-makers to analyze and improve service delivery.
# üìä Key Metrics Covered:
‚Ä¢	Patient Overview: Tracks the total number of patients (e.g., 513 in January) to monitor ER traffic trends and prepare staffing and resource planning accordingly.
‚Ä¢	Average Wait Time: Measures the time patients spend before being attended by a healthcare professional, helping assess the efficiency of hospital operations.
‚Ä¢	Patient Satisfaction Score: Captures patient feedback on their ER experience, giving a direct insight into service quality and areas for improvement.
# üõèÔ∏è Admission Analysis:
‚Ä¢	Displays a split between Admitted and Not Admitted patients, offering visibility into the conversion rate of ER visits into inpatient cases. This helps in capacity planning and resource allocation.
# üë• Patient Demographics:
‚Ä¢	Age-wise Distribution: Shows patient count across various age groups (0‚Äì79 years), identifying age-related trends and potential health focus areas.
‚Ä¢	Gender-wise Analysis: Highlights the male-female patient ratio, which supports targeted health programs and resource planning.
# ‚è±Ô∏è Attendance Status:
‚Ä¢	Compares the number of on-time vs delayed patient attendances to track operational punctuality and identify bottlenecks in service delivery.
# üè• Departmental Referrals:
‚Ä¢	Displays how many patients are referred to various departments such as General Practice, Orthopedics, Cardiology, Neurology, etc., helping assess departmental load and inter-departmental coordination.
# üìÖ Time Navigation:
‚Ä¢	Monthly buttons (Jan‚ÄìDec) allow users to interactively filter the data by month while still maintaining a cumulative yearly overview. This enhances usability and supports both trend analysis and detailed monthly reviews.

# üéØ Objective of the Dashboard
The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and real-time overview of key metrics related to hospital emergency room operations. It helps stakeholders monitor:
‚Ä¢	Patient Volume: Total number of patients per month.
‚Ä¢	Operational Efficiency: Average wait times and patient attend status (on-time vs. delayed).
‚Ä¢	Patient Experience: Satisfaction scores and admission rates.
‚Ä¢	Demographics: Patient age group distribution and gender analysis.
‚Ä¢	Departmental Insights: Patient referrals by medical departments.
This dashboard enables healthcare administrators to identify performance gaps, allocate resources efficiently, and improve patient care delivery.
# ‚öôÔ∏è Process & Steps Involved:
# 1. Data Collection:
‚Ä¢	Collected raw data for the month of January 2024.
‚Ä¢	Data categories likely include patient records, timestamps, gender, department referred, admission details, and feedback scores.
# 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
‚Ä¢	Removed duplicates, corrected errors, formatted date/time values.
‚Ä¢	Ensured consistent entries (e.g., Male/Female instead of M/F).
# 3. Pivot Tables & Charts:
‚Ä¢	Used Pivot Tables to summarize categorical data (e.g., admission status, age groups).
‚Ä¢	Created bar charts for:
o	Age group distribution
o	Department referrals
‚Ä¢	Created pie/donut charts for:
o	Gender analysis
o	Attendance status
‚Ä¢	Line/Area charts might represent trend lines (as shown behind metrics).
# 4. Dashboard Layout:
‚Ä¢	Used Excel shapes, icons, and slicers (e.g., month selection on the left).
‚Ä¢	Organized KPIs into panels for clear readability.
‚Ä¢	Conditional formatting may have been used for emphasis.
# 5. Interactivity:
‚Ä¢	Month-wise slicer allows users to switch between monthly reports.
‚Ä¢	Dynamic data updates when a new month is selected.

# Dashboard 2: Daily Volume Trend
Focus: Shows how many instances (likely customers, tasks, or visits) occurred daily.
‚Ä¢	Use: Helps identify busy days (like 5-Jan, 14-Jan, 28-Jan with values 22, 25, and 20) and low-activity days (e.g., 19-Jan with a value of 10).
‚Ä¢	Insight: Perfect for workload analysis or capacity planning.

# Dashboard 3: Wait Time Analysis
Focus: Displays average wait times for each day.
‚Ä¢	Use: Detects days where wait times were unusually high (e.g., 8-Jan: 43.52 mins, 19-Jan: 41.60 mins), suggesting possible inefficiencies.
‚Ä¢	Insight: These peaks could relate to staff shortages, high traffic, or technical issues.

# Dashboard 4: Satisfaction Trend
Focus: Tracks daily customer satisfaction scores.
‚Ä¢	Use: Indicates satisfaction dips on certain days (e.g., 31-Jan: 1.40; 9-Jan: 3.00), which can be cross-referenced with busy days or long wait times.
‚Ä¢	Insight: A sharp drop in satisfaction often coincides with high volume or wait times‚Äîvaluable for identifying root causes.
# Summary of Insights
The dashboards reveal a strong connection between daily customer volume, wait time, and satisfaction levels. High customer volume often leads to longer wait times, which negatively impacts satisfaction. However, efficient handling on high-volume days can still maintain high satisfaction scores, as seen on specific dates. Notably, low volume doesn‚Äôt always ensure better service, indicating possible inefficiencies. Overall, maintaining consistent operational performance and balancing resources according to traffic patterns are key to improving both wait times and customer satisfaction.
